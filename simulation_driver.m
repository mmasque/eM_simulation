    It produces 2 binary state TPMs:
        - random_tpm is random in its transitions: 
                    0.5, 0.5
                    0.5, 0.5
        - alternating_tpm maps an alternating series:
                    0.0, 1.0
                    1.0, 0.0

    From these TPMs, two binary time series are generated:
        - random_timeseries from random_tpm
        - alternating_timeseries from alternating_tpm
    
    These time series are combined to build an Epsilon Machine (e-machine 
    or eM).

    There are various methods to combine the timeseries:
        - merge_altern_slices(dset1, dset2, l)
            * produces a txt file of a time series with alternating slices 
              of length l from dset1 and dset2
            * view a more detailed documentation in alternating.m
                - multiline options

    The datafile is used to create an e-machine using run_CSSR() and a
    binary alphabet. 
        - What will happen as we vary L?

        - think about how to extend this to non-markovian datasets.
